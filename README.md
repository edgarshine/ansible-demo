# ansible-demo
This is a repository to ease Ansible demonstration on Arista Switches.
The repo contains playbook and Jinja templates examples, so it can easily be changed.
Initial version intend to push configs to a topology with two spines and a pair of pods, one containing a pair of MLAG switches
and a standalone switch.
Future versions will increase automation to eliminate the need to create static host and group vars
